      Been kicking around the idea of learning to write a coding language,
      definately not sure about which and starting to think it doesn't really
      matter, for a little over a year now. After setting up a node myself at
      home while learning about the Lighting Network last spring I learned a lot
      of command line by accident and found it to be not only rewarding but it
      completely altered my understanding of the internet and computers overall.
